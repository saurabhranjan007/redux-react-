#. Reducers are simply funcitons that (ultimately) returns some state 

#. Action Creator - 
        action creator basically is a function that dispatches an action to the reducer and then reducer goes and interprets the action and then manipulates the store 

#. Error:
    Uncaught Error: Actions must be plain objects. Instead, the actual type was:

    Explanation:
        Even tho if you haven't explicitely defined anything async but the "dispatch" function that you're using is async and this error happens 'coz of that.
        
    Resolution: 
        To resolve the error, you will need to use "redux-thunk" and "applyMiddleware - from redux"
        - add reux thunk middleware as the third param inside the store, that ought to solve the issue i.e., "applyMiddleware(thunk)"
        - this also alows you to make async calls
